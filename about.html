                <p>My name is Gus and I am the SGT at Arms of the 5th Division Black Spades. I am also the tech guy of the family and decided the spades need to have a better footprint in the world as far as tech is concerned. We are looking to branch out more and live up to our motto that we dont die. The Black Spades have been around since approximately 1968! That's 55 years strong, and I intend to keep us around indefinitely. I will be doing many interviews in regards to the official spades history, so I won't go deep into that right now. Instead, I wanna put the spotlight on just a few of the exceptional brothers and sisters we have in our family. So on to the shoutouts.</p>
